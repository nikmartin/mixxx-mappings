My Mixxx Controller mappings

These are my personal mappings for the Controllers I use with Mixxx. Feel free to use them. 

Notable differences from the mixxx built-in mapping:
 
 * the pad trans LED flashes with the beat
 * SHIFT + PAD TRANS activaes a brake and soft start effect, like a turntable
